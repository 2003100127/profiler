introduction,"I am working broadly in computational biology at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). I use mathematical algorithms to model biological systems in **structural biology**, **molecular biology** and **cancer biology**. I am carving out a niche for myself as a leading researcher in UMI-assisted research and computational drug discovery."
patent_aside,I applied the golden rule to a protein material study:\ protein structures determine their functions. This is used to screen synthetic proteins with similar biological activities to commericialised proteins.
academic_publication_aside,"I updated my latest research at these websites on a regular basis. I primarily published articles in the topics of methods, computational tools, and their applications in molecular and disease biology."
computational_tool_aside,"I am passionate about fantastic techniques applied in data science for biological systems. I have developed dozens of tools and methods, with nearly 15 publicly available to check and use. I will release more!!"
